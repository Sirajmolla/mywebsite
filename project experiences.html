This project help me in making aware of our environment and also realised me about the beauty we have got.<br>I also made some project when my school was going to oraganise  a science exhibition. In that exhibition, i had worked on two or three project with a group of five students.We had made model of a hydel power, model of a green city and also done some chemical experiments during the exhibition. This project make me familiar with phenomenon of science. I enjoyed this project and curiosity for this project was also high.<br>In the current time i recently worked on another project.
