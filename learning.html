<p>During my b.tech program, i want to get new experiences in my learning. i want to learn many new things such as programming languages, web development, android development, machine learning,etc. At my initial stage in this program, i am very keen to know about them. I think that after learning all this, i wil find myself completely engaged in my stream. In stead of learning in my stream, i also want to learn many new games that i have never played before. It is interesting to me learning all these new things.</p>

 <p>I also want to improve my communation skills, since i want to build my personality. I have heard that data structure and alogorithms are more important than one can imagine, so i have interest on this as well. My college is providing many extra curriculum activities, where i can show my interests such as dancing, photography, art, and many more things. After coming in this program, now my desire is to forget about the windows os and start exploring about linux os. Therefore, i have installed ubuntu in my pc and now i am trying to go through this operating system.   </p>
